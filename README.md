## To Do App

Simple To Do project using Vite + React + Yarn + Sass + React Icons + Json Server

### Getting Started
- run 'yarn server' to start the Json Server. It will run on port 5000
- run 'yarn dev' to start the dev build

### Running the project on Replit
- '.replit' and 'replit.nix' are necessary to run the project on Replit. But 'Json Server' component won't work on Replit since it uses a second localhost port and the system is not able to fetch from it
